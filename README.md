Animal Detection using Machine Learning:

Welcome to the Animal Detection project â€“ a machine learning-based notebook built with love on Google Colab. This project uses a classification model to detect animals from a custom image dataset.

Features:

1. Detects and classifies animals in images
   
2. Uses pre-trained models + custom fine-tuning
   
3. Includes accuracy and performance metrics
   
4. Built entirely on Google Colab
   
Tech Stack:

->Tool	Use

->Python	Core programming language

->PyTorch	ML model training

->Google Colab	Notebook environment

->Matplotlib	Visualization of results

How to Use:

* Upload your dataset to Google Drive.
  
* Mount Drive in the notebook.
  
* Run all cells in MLmain.ipynb.
  
* See classification results and accuracy.

Future Improvements:
Real-time animal detection via webcam,
Mobile app integration,
Larger dataset training on TPU.
